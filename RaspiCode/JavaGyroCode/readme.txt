            - The primary function of this code allowed me to get a good introduction to android studio code and
            presented a javascript alternative to open a network socket with the Raspberry pi in order to
            transmit data in real-time. **This is actually not even used within mainactivity.java but served as
            the stepping stone for the research and development
            *** THE PRIMARY FUNCTION OF THIS CODE IS TO ONLY CONTROL THE GYROSCOPE SERVO MECHANISM

The code in this folder is almost entirely the works of Daniel Ross and modified for my own local network socket and servo motor limits as well as the variables required to move the servos with the Gyroscope sensor. I was unfamiliar with Javascript and learnt most of it from Daniel Ross' youtube series.
