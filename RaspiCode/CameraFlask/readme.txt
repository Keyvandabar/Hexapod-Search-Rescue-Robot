            - The primary function of this code allowed me to get a good introduction to opening and 
            streaming a flask camera stream with little to no latency in the video stream. After countless
            attempts at trying different methods of streaming the video I found this github and source
            to provide the best quality vs latency ratio and decided to adopt it to the program.
            *** THE PRIMARY FUNCTION OF THIS CODE IS TO ONLY STREAM THE VIDEO TO A LOCAL HTML PAGE

            The code for the Camera module is primarily the works of Even Kouao and modified to fit my requirements as well as the user interface within the index.html file. (Removing his buttons and transparent bars so when it was displayed in the android app it looked clean.
