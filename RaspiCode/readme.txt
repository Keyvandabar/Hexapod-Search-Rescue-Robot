I have seperated the Java folder and the Flask folder to better show that the codes bare bones were of other people and edited/manipulated for my own variables and use.

The code found in this section is entirely made by me with the help of the SSC-32U Documentation found here: 
/*

            Title: SSC-32U
            Author: Lynxmotion

            Code version: *
            Availability: https://www.robotshop.com/media/files/pdf2/lynxmotion_ssc-32u_usb_user_guide.pdf
            - The PDF / Documentation provided with the SSC-32U provided decent instructions on how to 
            communicate through serial communication from the Raspberry Pi to the SSC-32U. The most useful 
            part of this documentation was to discover its ability to send a signal to numerous servo motors 
            at the same time.
            *** THE PRIMARY FUNCTION OF THIS CODE IS TO ONLY WORK AS A KIND OF LIBRARY TO WORK FROM

The inverse kinematic equations are present in the code but DO NOT provide any actual function to the project and is for future iterations of the project. 
The source for that is https://toglefritz.com/hexapod-inverse-kinematics-equations/

            - The inspiration to adopt Inverse Kinematics came from this source and provided 
            some insight on how a mathematical approach is the best course of action if the 
            robot was to traverse more difficult terrain in furute iterations.
