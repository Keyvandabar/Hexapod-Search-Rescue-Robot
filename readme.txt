This is a repository for final project code for the Hexapod Search and Rescue Robot. 
Within this repository you will find the product of many hours of coding, debugging, and troubleshooting required to get the client/server code responsible for real-time data transmission between the two. Within these folders you will see both the code for the Android Smartphone App, Raspberry Pi Microcontroller Server, and Python movement sequencing. The languages used within this project include Javascript, Node.js, C#, C++, and Python. All of which communicate or react off of one another through the network sockets created.
