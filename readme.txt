This is a repository for final project code for the Hexapod Search and Rescue Robot.
Course Title: PROJ220
- Final version of the COAP 222 Final project included designing, creating, and coding a fully wireless Hexapod Search & Rescue Robot.
- Javascript and Node.js to create network sockets for real-time transmission of data between a client and server with a Raspberry Pi Microcontroller and Android Smartphone app. As well as executing SSH scripts from the smartphone on the Raspberry Pi.
- Sequencing written in Python for control of 18+ Servo Motors simultaneously.
- Real-time, low-latency video stream from the Raspberry Pi to the Android Smartphone app to provide the Point of View for the Search & Rescue Robot.
- Gyroscope sensor values from the smartphone wirelessly control a servo panning mechanism in the same direction the user orients the phone in their hands.
- Extensive programming in both the Linux and Windows environments.

Within this repository you will find the product of many hours of coding, debugging, and troubleshooting required to get the client/server code responsible for real-time data transmission between the two. Within these folders you will see both the code for the Android Smartphone App, Raspberry Pi Microcontroller Server, and Python movement sequencing. The languages used within this project include Javascript, Node.js, C#, C++, and Python. All of which communicate or react off of one another through the network sockets created.
